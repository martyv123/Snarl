-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 1
For the game Snarl, we have come up with a project analysis that will detail the high-level implementation of this game. For our player models, we have identified several key components. The player must be able to identify their location and possible locations to travel. The player must also have the ability to recognize if they have found the key or exit to the dungeon (we will call this an interaction). If an adversary expels the player, the player must be removed from the level and will have no further actions on the instance of that level. In the future, players may be augmented with levelling and health systems. For our automated adversaries, there are similar components to be implemented such as location and movement. Room models will consist of rectangular gridded areas with tiles designated for player or adversary movements. Hallways will be implemented similar to room models, and will lead into other rooms or hallways. <br> <br>
The game software will be composed of various parts that work collectively to achieve the game’s purpose. The game will keep track of all playable levels, all rooms, all keys, the current level, the current room, active and expelled players, adversaries, game interactions, and the game state. The game interactions are defined as player/adversary movements and player/adversary interactions. The game state will be defined as one of three states: In Progress, Lose, or Win. If the players win the level, all players including expelled players will move onto the next level and if they lose the level, they must restart on the same level. The game state is updated with all interactions. Players win the game if the key and exit to the dungeon level is found, and lose the game if all players are eliminated. <br> <br>
Parts of the game’s software will need to communicate with each other in order to fulfill the requirements of the game. Players will have a limited view of the dungeon, and must not be able to move to a tile that is occupied. Adversaries will have a full view of the dungeon, and will not have the same interactions that players have. There are specific constraints on movement for both players and adversaries. The game state will keep track of whether the dungeon key and exit has been found (updating the game state as necessary), and if the adversaries have eliminated all of the players. While there is much more to be discussed, this provides a brief high-level overview of the functionality of the game. <br> <br>

## Part 2
In order to implement the specifications as described in our plan, we will propose several milestones. We will have milestone 1 cover the basic data models of the game which consist of the game state, levels, rooms, players and adversaries. For milestone 2, we will focus on implementing the movement and interactions of players and adversaries and how they affect the game state. By milestone 3, we plan to have a working demo with the functionality described in our plan. Milestone 3 will be centered on creating a GUI that will allow users to actually play the game. Milestone 4 will be dedicated to implementing changes and updates to the game’s logic after a successful demo to the client. Milestone 5 will allow for outsourced adversary code to be implemented into our game. Finally, milestone 6 will feature final changes to the game’s logic and will lead to an alpha version of the game with full functionality.
